## Intro

Goal is to have multiple app or own data going into Beeminder.com for tracking, motivation, and a [quantified self] look at data in one location.

This repo for now will only deal with HarvestApp.com time tracking being pushed to Beeminder goals.

--

Another repo will deal with Basecamp.com pushes to Beeminder goals.

So some overlap of code between the repos. When things are more settled, might combine repos or something.

**Maybe**
